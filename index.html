                <h4>Zone Aware Routing: Improved intra availability zone routing with ROI of $2 million.</h4>
                <ul>
                        <li>Reduced inter-AZ production inter-AZ traffic to 40% of its original value. Deprecated error prone load balancing components.</li>
                        <li>Migrated 1416 microservices to envoy load balancing subsets.</li>
                        <li>Wrote design spec and grafana/kibana dashboards. Communicated with customer teams to debug load balancing edge cases.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>No More Yaml (NoMoYa): Decreased time-to-deploy networking settings from 15 minutes to less than 30 seconds.</h4>
                <ul>
                        <li>Implemented new configuration API server (GoLang) and user interface (TypeScript + React) handling circuit breakers, health check endpoints, traffic migrations, and network dependency allow lists.</li>
                        <li>Improved team operations through self-service SEV mitigation, preventing context switching from team members.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Control Plane Backend Sharding: Collaborated with tech lead to simplify endpoint discovery.</h4>
                <ul>
                        <li>Transitioned from leader-elected writers to independent writers, enhancing service reliability and simplifying the deployment pipeline.</li>
                        <li>Implemented new data layer on control plane frontend and backend with 0 downtime, and a 99.95% mesh availability SLA.</li>
                        <li>Parallelized service discovery queue reducing endpoint query latency by roughly 50%.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Networking Day-to-Day</h4>
                <ul>
                        <li>Participated in debugging and mitigating more than 100 incidents through analyzing various kibana and prometheus queries, and SSHing into hosts themselves to validate networking components.</li>
                        <li>Performed technical deep dives on load balancing, did 30+ candidate interviews, actively helped in team planning, and acted as mentor for both interns and new-hires.</li>

                <h4>IP Whitelisting and Subdomains: Implemented requirements with ROI of $1.8 M / Year.</h4>
                <ul>
                        <li>Implemented new authorization service in GoLang scaling to roughly 10M requests / day. Authorization service handled: vanity subdomains, IP whitelisting, and proxying to core auth service.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>API Gateway: Deployed new API gateway edge proxy serving 30M requests / day with a 99.95% success rate SLA.</h4>
                <ul>
                        <li>Defined and deployed envoy edge proxy configures separate listeners for internal/external clients, and multi-region traffic.</li>
                        <li>Deployed ratelimit service with a centralized configuration repo, reducing DDOS risk and putting backpressure on noisy internal services.</li>
